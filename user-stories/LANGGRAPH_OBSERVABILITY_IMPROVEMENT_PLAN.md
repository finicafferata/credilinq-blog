## Technical Architecture Enhancements

### 1. Master Planner Agent Architecture

```python
class MasterPlannerAgent(WorkflowAgent):
    """
    Central orchestrator that decides execution order and manages workflow state
    """
    
    async def create_execution_plan(self, campaign_id: str) -> ExecutionPlan:
        """
        Analyze campaign requirements and create optimal agent execution plan
        """
        
    async def monitor_execution_progress(self, execution_plan_id: str) -> WorkflowStatus:
        """
        Real-time monitoring of agent execution with dynamic re-planning
        """
        
    async def handle_agent_completion(self, agent_id: str, result: AgentResult) -> NextActions:
        """
        Process agent completion and determine next steps in workflow
        """
```

### 2. Enhanced Database Schema Extensions

Building on your existing schema, we'll add:

```sql
-- Execution Plan Management
CREATE TABLE execution_plans (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    campaign_id UUID REFERENCES campaigns(id),
    workflow_execution_id UUID,
    planned_sequence JSONB, -- Ordered list of agents with dependencies
    current_step INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_steps INTEGER,
    execution_strategy VARCHAR(50), -- sequential, parallel, adaptive
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Agent Dependency Mapping
CREATE TABLE agent_dependencies (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    execution_plan_id UUID REFERENCES execution_plans(id),
    agent_id VARCHAR(100),
    depends_on_agents VARCHAR(100)[], -- Array of prerequisite agent IDs
    execution_order INTEGER,
    is_parallel_eligible BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Real-time Workflow State
CREATE TABLE workflow_state_live (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_execution_id UUID UNIQUE,
    current_agents_running VARCHAR(100)[],
    completed_agents VARCHAR(100)[],
    failed_agents VARCHAR(100)[],
    waiting_agents VARCHAR(100)[],
    execution_metadata JSONB,
    last_heartbeat TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 3. Observability Components

```python
class WorkflowObserver:
    """
    Real-time workflow observation and metrics collection
    """
    
    async def track_workflow_start(self, workflow_id: str, plan: ExecutionPlan)
    async def track_agent_transition(self, from_agent: str, to_agent: str, state: Dict)
    async def track_decision_point(self, decision: AgentDecision, alternatives: List[str])
    async def generate_progress_report(self, workflow_id: str) -> ProgressReport

class ErrorRecoveryManager:
    """
    Intelligent error handling and recovery strategies
    """
    
    async def classify_error(self, error: Exception, context: AgentContext) -> ErrorType
    async def determine_recovery_strategy(self, error_type: ErrorType) -> RecoveryStrategy
    async def execute_recovery(self, strategy: RecoveryStrategy, checkpoint: StateCheckpoint)
```
