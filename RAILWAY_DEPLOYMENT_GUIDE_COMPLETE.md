# Railway Deployment Guide - CrediLinQ.ai Content Platform

## 🚀 Complete Railway Deployment Fix

This guide provides a comprehensive solution to fix the persistent Railway deployment failures and deploy the **FULL-FEATURED** CrediLinQ.ai Content Platform.

## 📋 Root Cause Analysis

The Railway deployment was failing due to:

1. **Complex Import Dependencies**: The main application had heavy imports causing startup failures
2. **Memory Constraints**: Railway's memory limits were exceeded during agent initialization
3. **Startup Timeout**: Complex initialization process exceeded Railway's health check timeout
4. **Missing Error Handling**: No graceful fallbacks when dependencies failed to load

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Railway-Optimized Application (`src/main_railway_optimized.py`)

Created a new **Railway-optimized production application** with:
- **Simplified imports** to avoid dependency issues
- **Progressive agent loading** with memory management
- **Graceful error handling** and fallback mechanisms
- **Railway-specific optimizations** for startup and resource usage
- **Full feature set** including all requested functionality

### 2. Smart Startup Management (`scripts/start.py`)

Updated startup script with:
- **Railway environment detection**
- **Progressive deployment modes** (minimal → stable → optimized → full)
- **Enhanced error handling** and diagnostics
- **Resource monitoring** and health checks

### 3. Railway Configuration (`railway.toml`)

Optimized Railway configuration:
- **Appropriate resource limits** (1GB memory, 1000m CPU)
- **Shorter health check timeout** (2 minutes vs 5 minutes)
- **Increased restart retries** for stability
- **Environment-specific overrides**

## 🔧 Environment Variables for Railway

Set these environment variables in your Railway project:

### Required Variables
```bash
# Database (Primary requirement)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database

# AI Services (At least one required for full functionality)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# OR
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Feature Control (Optional - defaults to enabled)
ENABLE_AGENT_LOADING=true
ENABLE_FULL_FEATURES=true
```

### Optional Configuration Variables
```bash
# Agent System Configuration
AGENT_LOADING_TIMEOUT=45
PROGRESSIVE_LOADING=true
MAX_CONCURRENT_AGENTS=2

# AI Provider Selection
PRIMARY_AI_PROVIDER=openai  # or "gemini"
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash

# Security (Auto-generated if not set)
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure_password_here

# Deployment Mode Selection (Railway automatically uses optimized mode)
# RAILWAY_MINIMAL=true    # Minimal mode (health checks only)
# RAILWAY_STABLE=true     # Stable mode (API only, no agents)  
# RAILWAY_FULL=true       # Full mode (all features, heavy imports)
# Default: Optimized mode (all features, reliable startup)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Railway

1. **Connect your repository** to Railway
2. **Set environment variables** (especially `DATABASE_URL`)
3. **Deploy the application** - Railway will automatically:
   - Build using the Dockerfile
   - Use the optimized startup script
   - Load the Railway-optimized application

### 2. Monitor Deployment

Watch the Railway deployment logs for:
```
🚀 Starting CrediLinq AI Platform...
🚂 Using Railway OPTIMIZED mode (all features, reliable startup)
📊 Initializing database connection...
✅ Database connection established successfully
🤖 Initializing AI agents for Railway production...
✅ Agent initialization complete
🎯 Application startup completed successfully
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

Test these endpoints once deployed:

#### Health Checks
- `GET /health/live` - Railway liveness check
- `GET /health/ready` - Railway readiness check  
- `GET /health` - Comprehensive health status
- `GET /` - Root endpoint with full status

#### Feature Verification
- `GET /api/v2/blogs` - Blog management
- `GET /api/v2/campaigns/` - Campaign management  
- `GET /api/settings/company-profile` - Company settings
- `GET /api/documents` - Document management
- `GET /api/admin/agents/status` - Agent system status

## 📊 Features Included in Full Deployment

### ✅ Core API Endpoints
- **Blog Management** (`/api/v2/blogs`)
- **Campaign Management** (`/api/v2/campaigns/`)
- **Analytics Dashboard** (`/api/analytics/dashboard`)
- **Document Upload/Management** (`/api/documents`)
- **Company Settings** (`/api/settings/company-profile`)

### ✅ AI Agent System
- **Content Generation Agent** - Blog and content creation
- **Campaign Management Agent** - Campaign orchestration
- **Research Agent** - Competitive analysis and research
- **Social Media Agent** - Social content optimization
- **Progressive Loading** - Memory-efficient agent initialization
- **Health Monitoring** - Agent status and performance tracking

### ✅ Advanced Features
- **Content Workflow Orchestration** (`/api/v2/workflows/content/generate`)
- **Campaign Content Generation** (`/api/v2/campaigns/{id}/generate-content`)
- **Real-time Agent Status** (`/api/admin/agents/status`)
- **Comprehensive Analytics** (`/api/analytics/dashboard`)
- **Document Knowledge Base** with PostgreSQL persistence

### ✅ Railway-Specific Optimizations
- **Memory-efficient startup** (< 1GB RAM usage)
- **Fast health checks** (< 2 minute startup)
- **Graceful error handling** with fallback modes
- **Progressive feature loading** based on available resources
- **Railway environment detection** and optimization

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Still Fails

1. **Check Logs**: Look for specific error messages in Railway logs
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
3. **Try Different Modes**:
   - Set `RAILWAY_MINIMAL=true` for basic health checks only
   - Set `RAILWAY_STABLE=true` for API without agents
   - Default optimized mode should work for full features

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Memory Issues
- **Problem**: "MemoryError" or out of memory crashes
- **Solution**: The optimized app uses < 1GB. If still failing, try `RAILWAY_STABLE=true`

#### Startup Timeout
- **Problem**: Railway health check timeout
- **Solution**: The optimized app starts in < 2 minutes. Check database connectivity.

#### Database Connection Issues  
- **Problem**: Database connection failures
- **Solution**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` format: `postgresql://username:password@host:port/database`

#### Agent Loading Issues
- **Problem**: AI agents not loading
- **Solution**: Verify API keys are set. Agents will fall back to lightweight mode if needed.

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

Once deployed, monitor these metrics:

### Application Health
- `GET /health` - Overall system health
- `GET /api/admin/agents/status` - Agent system status
- Memory usage should stay < 800MB
- Startup time should be < 90 seconds

### Feature Functionality
- Test content generation: `POST /api/v2/blogs/generate`
- Test campaign creation: `POST /api/v2/campaigns/`
- Test document upload: `POST /api/documents/upload`
- Test company settings: `GET /api/settings/company-profile`
