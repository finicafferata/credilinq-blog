# Automated Agent Execution & Real-Time Progress User Stories

## Overview
Implementation plan for automatically running AI agents when campaigns are created and showing real-time content generation progress to users.

## Phase 1: Integrate Campaign Creation with Automatic Agent Execution

### Story 1.1: Automatic Agent Workflow Trigger
**As a** content marketing manager  
**I want** AI agents to automatically start analyzing and optimizing content when I create a new campaign  
**So that** I don't have to manually trigger each analysis step

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When I create a new campaign, the system automatically triggers the content generation workflow
- The system runs all AI agents (Writer, SEO, Brand, Content Quality, GEO) in sequence
- Agent execution happens in the background without blocking the UI
- I can see that the process has started immediately after campaign creation
- The system creates appropriate database records for tracking agent performance

**Technical Implementation:**
- Modify campaign creation endpoint to trigger BackgroundTasks
- Integrate with existing `content_generation_workflow.py`
- Use FastAPI BackgroundTasks or async task queue
- Connect to `CampaignOrchestratorAgent` for workflow management

### Story 1.2: Content Generation Pipeline
**As a** content creator  
**I want** the system to automatically generate blog content and optimize it with all AI agents  
**So that** I have publication-ready content without manual intervention

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Campaign creation triggers blog post generation using Writer Agent
- SEO Agent automatically analyzes and optimizes the generated content
- Brand Agent ensures voice and tone consistency
- Content Quality Agent evaluates readability and structure
- GEO Agent optimizes for AI search engines and answer engines
- All agent results are stored in the agent_performance and agent_decisions tables

### Story 1.3: Background Processing Status
**As a** user  
**I want** to know that agents are working on my campaign in the background  
**So that** I understand the system is processing my request

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Campaign status shows "Processing" or "Generating Content" during agent execution
- System provides estimated completion times
- User can navigate away and return to see progress
- Errors in background processing are captured and reported

## Phase 2: Real-Time Status Updates with WebSocket Support

### Story 2.1: Live Progress Updates
**As a** content manager  
**I want** to see real-time updates of agent progress  
**So that** I know exactly what's happening with my campaign

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WebSocket connection established when viewing campaign details
- Live updates show which agent is currently running
- Progress indicators show completion percentage for each agent
- Updates appear immediately without page refresh
- Connection handles network interruptions gracefully

**Technical Implementation:**
- FastAPI WebSocket endpoint: `/ws/campaign/{campaign_id}/status`
- React useWebSocket hook for frontend connectivity
- WebSocket message format: `{agent_type, status, progress, estimated_completion}`
- Connection manager for multiple concurrent users

### Story 2.2: Agent Status Broadcasting
**As a** user  
**I want** to receive live notifications when agents complete their analysis  
**So that** I can review results immediately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Real-time notifications when each agent completes
- Success/failure status for each agent execution
- Ability to see agent results as they become available
- Toast notifications for important status changes
- Persistent status even if user temporarily disconnects

### Story 2.3: Multi-User Status Sync
**As a** team member  
**I want** to see live updates when other team members are working on campaigns  
**So that** we can collaborate effectively without conflicts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Multiple users can watch the same campaign progress simultaneously
- Updates broadcast to all connected users for that campaign
- User presence indicators show who else is viewing
- Status changes sync across all connected clients

## Phase 3: Show Content Generation Progress in UI

### Story 3.1: Visual Progress Dashboard
**As a** user  
**I want** visual progress indicators showing content generation stages  
**So that** I can understand what's happening and how long it will take

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Progress bars showing completion percentage for overall campaign
- Individual agent status cards (running, completed, failed, pending)
- Estimated time remaining for each agent
- Visual indicators that update in real-time via WebSocket
- Color-coded status: blue (running), green (completed), red (failed), gray (pending)

### Story 3.2: Live Content Preview
**As a** content reviewer  
**I want** to see content as it's being generated and optimized  
**So that** I can preview results before agents finish completely

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Content preview updates as Writer Agent generates text
- SEO optimization changes show in real-time
- Brand consistency improvements are visible as they happen
- GEO optimizations display incrementally
- Version history shows how content evolved through agent pipeline

### Story 3.3: Agent Execution Timeline
**As a** project manager  
**I want** to see a timeline of agent execution with timestamps  
**So that** I can understand performance and identify bottlenecks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Timeline view showing start/end times for each agent
- Execution duration for performance monitoring
- Parallel vs sequential execution visualization
- Historical comparison with previous campaigns
- Export timeline data for analysis

## Phase 4: Connect Trigger Endpoints to Actual Agent Workflows

### Story 4.1: Manual Agent Re-execution
**As a** content editor  
**I want** to manually trigger individual agent re-analysis  
**So that** I can refresh analysis after making content changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- "Run Analysis" buttons execute actual agents, not mock responses
- Individual agent triggers (SEO only, Brand only, etc.)
- Re-execution updates existing analysis results
- Previous results are archived for comparison
- Manual triggers follow the same real-time update patterns

### Story 4.2: Agent Workflow Integration
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** trigger endpoints to execute real agent workflows  
**So that** the system provides actual AI analysis instead of mock data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `/trigger-analysis` endpoint executes actual agent code
- Integration with existing LangGraph agent workflows
- Proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Performance tracking in agent_performance table
- Queue management for concurrent agent executions

**Technical Implementation:**
- Update `trigger_agent_analysis` to call real agents
- Connect to `content_generation_workflow.py` 
- Implement proper async execution with task tracking
- Add retry logic for failed agent executions

### Story 4.3: Agent Result Caching
**As a** user  
**I want** agent results to be cached to avoid redundant processing  
**So that** I get faster responses and the system is more efficient

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Recent agent results are cached and reused when appropriate
- Cache invalidation when content changes
- Option to force refresh analysis
- Cache hit/miss indicators for debugging
- Configurable cache duration per agent type

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Future Enhancements)

**So that** I can optimize system performance and identify issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard showing average agent execution times
- Success/failure rates per agent type
- Performance trends over time
- Bottleneck identification and alerts
- Cost tracking for agent executions

### Story 5.3: Custom Agent Workflows
**As a** advanced user  
**I want** to customize which agents run for different campaign types  
**So that** I can optimize processing for specific use cases

**Acceptance Criteria:**
