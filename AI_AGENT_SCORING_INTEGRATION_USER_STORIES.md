# AI Agent Scoring Integration - User Stories

## Epic: Connect Real AI Agent Scores to Campaign Review System

**Problem Statement**: The sophisticated AI agents (Quality Review, Brand Review, Content Quality, SEO, GEO) already calculate meaningful scores using advanced AI models, but these real scores are not flowing through to the frontend. Instead, mock/hardcoded data is displayed.

**Goal**: Connect authentic agent-generated scores to the campaign review UI to show real AI analysis instead of placeholder data.
